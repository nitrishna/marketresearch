# How Will Robots Reboot the Food Robotics Market in 2025 and Beyond?

According to the study by Next Move Strategy Consulting, the [**Food Robotics Market**](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/food-robotics-market) size is predicted to reach **USD 5.36 billion** by 2030 with a **CAGR** of **9.7%** from 2022-2030.

It is gaining new momentum as robotics technologies mature and find more applications in the food & beverage sector. The report defines this market as encompassing robots that perform tasks such as picking, sorting, packaging and palletizing in food manufacturing. 

In the context of 2025, there is a fresh wave of developments—from service-robots to advanced packaging automation—that are set to reboot the market.

**Automation Convergence: Production + Service:**

**Historically robotics in food focused on manufacturing lines**: palletising, slicing, sorting. The segmentations in the report cover these. 

However today, there’s convergence with service robotics (delivery, front-of-house operations) and advanced AI/vision systems. The pilot by Grubhub and Avride in robot-food delivery is a strong marker of this shift. 

Similarly, a burger restaurant using dual-arm robots shows food service applications expanding. 

This convergence means the Food Robotics Market is no longer “just factory automation” — it spans the full food ecosystem.

**Key Growth Enablers:**

**Several enablers are pushing the market forward:**

Hygienic, wash-down capable robotic arms designed for food processing (an article describes “Robot Washdown Revolution” where major OEMs are developing robotics that withstand harsh food-plant environments). 

AI/vision systems allowing robots to handle variability in food shapes, colours and packaging formats — increasingly important in food contexts.

Demand for speed, flexibility and cost-effectiveness, especially in light of labour shortages and food safety/regulation pressures.

Service/last-mile robotics growth (delivery robots navigating urban spaces).

**Regional & Vertical Focus:**

The Next Move report emphasises the Asia Pacific region as holding leadership, due to hygiene awareness, low labour cost alternatives and competitive FMCG environment. 

At the same time, the U.S. market sees growth in service and kitchen automation; for example robotic systems in restaurants and food delivery.
In terms of verticals: meat, poultry and seafood remain heavy users of robotics (due to handling, hygiene complexity). Meanwhile ready-to-eat and packaged foods are expanding robotics usage because of high throughput and automation suitability.

**Outlook & Implications**

Looking forward, food robotics is set to move from early adoption to more mainstream deployment. The blending of production, packaging and service robotics means broader value chains will adopt robotics. As robotics costs fall, as software and AI improve, adoption will accelerate.
Companies that integrate robotics thoughtfully—ensuring system compatibility, workforce training, process redesign—will gain competitive advantage: faster throughput, improved food safety, lower labour dependency, better flexibility. Those who treat robotics as an add-on rather than an integrated transformation may struggle.

**Conclusion**

In the period ahead, robotics is not merely an upgrade but a reboot for the Food Robotics Market. With technology enablers aligning and service applications expanding, the sector promises to reshape food production, packaging and delivery. The question for food-industry stakeholders is not whether to invest, but how to invest strategically, and how to build the infrastructure—technical, organisational and operational—to make robotics a backbone rather than a side-project.
